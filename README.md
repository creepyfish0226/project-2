# Description

For our project we created an app that uses the US Postal Service zip code database and mapbox to post maps and reviews of the area codes people are interested in moving too.

# Motivation
We wanted to create an app that allows a user to research an area by having the ability to read reviews from other users and view maps of the area they are planning to move too.

# Results
We created a visually pleasing and easy to use App.  A user can explore other users reviews of the area.

# Team Effort



# Challenges

Using a national zip code database with thousands of zipcodes would slow the execution of adding a review.  We had to narrow the zip code choices down to just the charlotte area for now.
Researching and implementing a favicon was not a simple task to figure out.  It took trial and error.  In the end it was one line of code.


# Improvements
